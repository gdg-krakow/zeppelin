  description: "Every front-end developer knows that Chrome DevTools rocks! It is a primary tool we work with every day. Mastering it is a must. Yet there is more to the story. Real front-end craftspersons don’t use a multi-tool for every task. Instead, they use a set of specialised tools to make their work more efficient. In the Chrome world, these tools are called Chrome Extensions.<br/>During my presentation, I will demonstrate several extensions I have built. I will explain how I built them. You’ll not only learn about new tools, but you will also see how easy it is to create them!"

  title: "Improve your communication skills dramatically without saying a word"
  description: "What I’d like to address to the community is the power of listening. I see listening as the hidden secret of good communication. Everyone focuses on improving their ability to speak, whether on stage or to clients, to better convey their message, but that’s the harder half of the communication challenge facing programmers, designers, and project stakeholders. </br>

                I’d like to address three aspects of listening: the power it gives to allow others to think more creatively, the function of the listening role, and specific techniques to improve listening skills. </br>

                Obviously, this is a topic that could be addressed at any conference to any audience, but since I’ve spent the past twenty years in IT in various roles, my experience and concerns are focused on making software teams more effective. I’m convinced that the next big advance in software delivery effectiveness will not come in the form of a tool or methodology, but in a renewed interest in the human side of collaboration and this is where my present interests lie."

  title: "The Leadership Gap"
  description: "I often hear complaints that we don’t have enough great leaders in our organizations.<br/>

                If, as Jerry Weinberg points, leadership is a process of creating an environment where people become empowered let’s focus on how we create and evolve environments we work at.<br/>

                One issue is the system. W. Edwards Deming famously said that a bad system will defeat a good person every time. Then we should discuss how we build our teams and how it contributes to our goals. Finally, we have organizational culture that is blood of every company and influence all behaviors.<br/>

                All these bits are inseparably interconnected thus if we want to create an environment where leadership thrives we need to take all of them into account.<br/>
                Let’s take a look at how these ideas may be applied in practice. In Lunar Logic eventually but inevitably everyone becomes a leader. We simply pay attention to how the organization is designed in a broader context. That’s the story I will share.<br/>

                After all, there's no shortage of leaders, only a shortage of companies that let leadership emerge."

However, if you want to create something that isn't limited to the `window` object, something that unleashes the full potential of the browser and allows you to utilize your JavaScript skills, you need to learn about Chrome extensions. These small programs can enhance, or modify, browser functionality and are extremely easy to develop. Care to learn more?"
