  description: "I would like to share information about using Android with Google Cast API (Chromecast  in particular). I would concentrate on Android part but I would say few words about web/js/ part too and show how to develop Chromecast ready apps without having this device. There would be small demonstrations too."

  title: "Front-End Tools Beyond DevTools"
  description: "Every front-end developer knows that Chrome DevTools rocks! It is a primary tool we work with every day. Mastering it is a must. Yet there is more to the story. Real front-end craftspersons don’t use a multi-tool for every task. Instead, they use a set of specialised tools to make their work more efficient. In the Chrome world, these tools are called Chrome Extensions.<br/>During my presentation, I will demonstrate several extensions I have built. I will explain how I built them. You’ll not only learn about new tools, but you will also see how easy it is to create them!"

  title: "The Leadership Gap"
  description: "I often hear complaints that we don’t have enough great leaders in our organizations.<br/>

                If, as Jerry Weinberg points, leadership is a process of creating an environment where people become empowered let’s focus on how we create and evolve environments we work at.<br/>

                One issue is the system. W. Edwards Deming famously said that a bad system will defeat a good person every time. Then we should discuss how we build our teams and how it contributes to our goals. Finally, we have organizational culture that is blood of every company and influence all behaviors.<br/>

                All these bits are inseparably interconnected thus if we want to create an environment where leadership thrives we need to take all of them into account.<br/>
                Let’s take a look at how these ideas may be applied in practice. In Lunar Logic eventually but inevitably everyone becomes a leader. We simply pay attention to how the organization is designed in a broader context. That’s the story I will share.<br/>

                After all, there's no shortage of leaders, only a shortage of companies that let leadership emerge."
